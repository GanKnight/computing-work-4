_parody of the song feel special_

(Please go listen it's a bop)

On the first day
I thought you were very strict
I felt so shy
Didn't want to say a word

Well then it all changed
You made the lessons very fun
We all learnt a lot from you
Although you do scold us
We know that you just want to teach us
Thank you for helping us learn!
