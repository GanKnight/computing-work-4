_parody of the song feel special_

(Please go listen it's a bop)

On the first day
I thought you were very strict
I felt so shy
Didn't want to say a word

Well then it all changed
You made the lessons very fun
We all learnt a lot from you
Although you do scold us
We know that you just want to teach us
Thank you for helping us learn!

Sometimes you can be stern
Sometimes you can be funny
Although at times you can be painfully honest
We still,see your concern for us.

Thank you for teaching us
At times we might be disappointing
But you never give up on us
Although your words might seem harsh
We know you mean well

Thanks for being a great teacher
Although sometimes we make you frustrated
And end up getting scolded
You still never fail to,
teach us,help us learn
